# ETHCC Hackathon 2022 -- Debate3

This is the official ETHCC Hackathon 2022 submission for our project Debate3. 
Debate 3 is a Decentralized, embeddable, commentary section token-gated discussion platform for DAOs ðŸŒˆ



## Project Description 

Debate3 has a Proof of Membership for it Forum Factory, stating that a for a user to access a forum they must hold at least one type of NFT for this specific Forum. Each user of a Forum receieves 1155s Badges (Bronze , Silver and Gold) minted as tokens, in batches summed up to a reputation score. 
Those badges are given by moderators of the forum that are selected by the creator of the Forum itself.  


## Features 




## TL;DR How it Works

1. Create a Forum minted as an NFT in IPFS and selecting up to 5 moderators. 
2. Moderators can provide membership or revoke membership to users, assert badges to users with a Proof of Contribution. 
3. Users will have their contribution score updated, this contribution score is stored only in the forum contract, so contribution score inside a forum is not related to the number of badges they have inside the protocol.
